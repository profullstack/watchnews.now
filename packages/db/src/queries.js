/**
 * Events whose play log is due a refresh.
 *
 * A summary response is ~500KB, so this is deliberately narrow and spaced: games
 * actually in progress, oldest-refreshed first, and capped. Re-reading every live
 * game every minute would cost more bandwidth than the rest of the app combined --
 * and all of it metered, since these go through the proxy.
 *
 * Plus one last read after the whistle. Scoping this to `in` alone lost the end of
 * every game: the poll runs every two minutes, the final score and the flip to
 * `post` arrive on the one-minute score tick, and the event stops matching before
 * the last drive is ever fetched -- so the recap on a finished game ended somewhere
 * short of the finish. `plays_final` is what closes one out, and we set it
 * ourselves: inferring it from `updated_at` moving looked equivalent and was not,
 * because the score tick writes that column for every fixture on a league's
 * scoreboard -- finished ones included -- for as long as that league has any game
 * in progress. Games that had ended hours earlier kept re-qualifying every minute,
 * so the queue churned instead of draining and each pass spent another 500KB per
 * fixture. `catchupHours` bounds how far back that closing read reaches, which is a
 * cost limit rather than a rule -- see config.sports.playsCatchupHours for widening
 * it to backfill history.
 *
 * `state = 'in'` on its own is not a claim that a game is on right now, only that
 * nothing ever said otherwise. A fixture the provider stops returning keeps that
 * state forever, and those accumulate -- so the poller spent its whole quota
 * re-reading finished games while the fixtures someone was actually watching sat
 * behind the cap and never got a first read at all. `updated_at` is the honest
 * signal: the score tick stamps it every minute for the leagues that have a game
 * on, so a row it is still touching is genuinely live, and one it has stopped
 * touching drops out on its own without anyone having to decide what counts as
 * "too long" for a sport whose fixtures can legitimately run for days.
 *
 * `plays_supported` keeps competitions that can never have a log out of the queue
 * entirely. Ten of the sixteen sports in the catalogue either return a boxscore and
 * nothing else, or have no summary for the kind of id we store -- and their fixtures
 * were taking slots every cycle to come back empty, ahead of leagues that do have a
 * log. See 0012_plays_supported.sql for how that was measured.
 *
 * Each row also carries how many matched in total. The caller only ever sees the
 * capped slice, so a queue it can never drain looks exactly like a queue it just
 * drained -- which is how live fixtures went a whole game without a play log while
 * the worker logged "0 failed" every two minutes. A window function is evaluated
 * before the limit, so this is the true total and costs no second round trip.
 *
 * One state at a time, because the two are not interchangeable and must not queue
 * behind each other. A live game needs reading again and again while it is on; a
 * finished one needs reading exactly once more. Drawn from one pool the finished
 * ones win on age alone -- 252 of them took every slot for an hour while the
 * fixtures actually being played got nothing -- so the caller asks for each
 * separately and gives the live ones the bulk of the quota.
