 * once and every brand gets it, and a new brand is an entry here rather than a

 *
 * What made this possible is that the schema already fits. `leagues` is a
 * collection of things, `teams` are the participants, `team_leagues` is already
 * many-to-many, and home/away are already nullable because a race and a fight card
 * have no two sides. A television series in a genre is that same shape wearing
 * different words -- so the words are what varies here, not the tables.
 *
 * What must NOT go in here: anything a reader could be harmed by getting wrong.
 * Rate limits, reminder correctness and privacy rules are the same everywhere and
 * live in code.
