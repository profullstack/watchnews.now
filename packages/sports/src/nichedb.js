/**
 * News, from nichedb.dev.
 *
 * Unlike every other adapter here, the upstream is ours: nichedb's `news`
 * collection already does the fetching, parsing and deduplication against
 * newsroom RSS and GDELT, and exposes the result as keyless JSON. So this
 * adapter is a projection, not a scraper — which is the point of having built
 * the collection there rather than a seventh set of feed parsers here.
 *
 * How news lands in a schema built for fixtures:
 *
 * - a **beat** becomes a league row. GDELT items carry their beat directly
 *   (`data.query`); newsroom items come from world desks, so their beat is
 *   `world` — that is a description of those seven feeds, not a catch-all.
 * - an **outlet** becomes a team row. For newsroom items that is the publisher
 *   (`data.outlet`); for GDELT it is the source domain, which is why this brand
 *   has hundreds of followable outlets rather than seven.
 * - a **story** becomes an event with one side, the way a race already is.
 *
 * The one thing the shared schema cannot express is tense. A fixture is
 * something that will happen; a story has already been published. Stories are
 * therefore ingested as `out`, which `stateOf` stores as `post`, and they reach
 * a reader through the home page (which asks for today, not for upcoming) and
 * the results page. Nothing here is ever `pre`, so this brand's "starting soon"
 * page is empty by construction rather than by accident, and its copy says so.
