/**
 * Non-sports providers, and how their output lands in the sports schema.
 *
 * The interesting thing here is that no schema change was needed. `leagues` is a
 * collection of things, `teams` are the participants, `team_leagues` is already
 * many-to-many, and `home_team_id`/`away_team_id` are already nullable because a
 * race and a fight card have no two sides. A television series inside a genre is
 * that same shape wearing different words -- so a genre becomes a league row, a
 * show becomes a team row, and an episode becomes an event with one side.
 *
 * The two genuinely new facts are `time_known` and `precision`, added in 0017,
 * because a release has a date and no hour where a fixture always has a kickoff.
 *
 * Which of these run is a brand decision (packages/config/src/brands.js), not a
 * code one: the sports brand runs espn, the genre brand runs these five.
