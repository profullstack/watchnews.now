/*
 * The last stop for a path this app does not have, and the only place a scanner
 * can be counted.
 *
 * Mostly what lands here asked for a path this app has never had, which readers
 * do rarely and scanners do hundreds of times in a row. The pages that answer a
 * reader's dead link -- an event that has been and gone, a profile that is
 * private -- render `<NotFound>` inside their own route and never reach this
 * handler, so a person following a stale link out of somebody's timeline is not
 * metered at all.
 *
 * The exception is the thirteen machine-facing routes that answer with a bare
 * `c.notFound()`: a calendar or RSS subscription to an event that no longer
 * exists, or an icon hash from a cached page. Those DO land here and are
 * counted, and that is acceptable precisely because of the next paragraph -- a
 * calendar client polling a dead feed hourly would need a day to reach the
 * allowance, and all it would get for it is a 429 where it was already getting
 * a 404.
 *
 * The refusal is deliberately confined to the miss itself. A locked caller is
 * still served normally by every route that exists, because the counter only
 * ever runs on this handler -- so the worst a false positive can do is answer
 * 429 instead of 404 to somebody who was going to get nothing either way. That
 * is the whole reason this can be turned on at all: unlike the auth curves,
 * this one cannot lock anybody out of anything real.
