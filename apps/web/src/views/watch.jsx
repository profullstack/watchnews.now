/**
 * Watching a news channel.

 * The rest of this site answers "when is it on" and then "where can I watch
 * it". News has no answer to the first and a strange answer to the second: you
 * cannot tune in to an article. What you can do is watch the desk -- so a
 * channel page is its own destination here rather than something hanging off an
 * event, and every section and outlet page links into it.
