 * from one-list-per-account: the address, the edit form, Refresh and the
 * connection cap all addressed "the reader's list" because there had only ever
 * been one. The result was that a second subscription could be added and deleted
 * and nothing else -- a typo in it meant deleting the row and typing a
 * password-bearing URL out again.
 *
 * So the card is a component and the page draws one per line. Every control on it
 * names the line it acts on, and every route behind it takes that id paired with
 * the session's own user id.
 *
 * `data-line` is what the reveal script scopes itself to; without it a Show press
 * on the second card fetched and filled the first.

        Opening the list to everybody signed in.

        Rendered only when there IS a list, and worded so the two consequences are
        read before the button is pressed rather than discovered afterwards. Both
        are real and neither is obvious:

          - a provider line permits a small number of simultaneous connections and
            suspends the account for exceeding it, so other people watching it are
            using the owner's allowance;
          - the site therefore refuses a shared entry while that line is busy,
            rather than cutting off whoever is already watching.

        What it does NOT do is hand anybody the URL, and that is why this is

    <h1>About TipoffWatch</h1>
    <p>
      A calendar for people who keep missing the start of games. Follow any team or competition and
      get told an hour before kickoff, and again a minute out — by web notification, email, or both.
    </p>

    <h2>What's in the directory</h2>
    <ul class="stats">
      <li>
        <strong>{stats.sports}</strong> sports
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>{stats.leagues}</strong> leagues
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>{stats.teams}</strong> teams
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>{stats.upcoming_events}</strong> upcoming fixtures
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted small">
      Fixtures last refreshed {stats.last_sync ? <LocalTime at={stats.last_sync} /> : 'not yet'}.
    </p>

    <h2>Where the data comes from</h2>
    <p>
      Schedules, teams and scores come from <strong>ESPN's public JSON API</strong> (
      <code>site.api.espn.com</code> and <code>sports.core.api.espn.com</code>). We are not
      affiliated with ESPN.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Every response is normalised and stored here, so the calendar keeps working when the upstream
      is slow or unavailable — it goes stale rather than blank. Fixtures refresh every few hours and
      the league catalogue daily.
    </p>

    <h2>Times</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      All times are stored in UTC and shown in your browser's own time zone (
      <span data-tz-label>your device</span>). Emailed reminders use the zone set in{' '}
      <a href="/settings">settings</a>, since an email has no browser to ask.
    </p>

    <h2>Is TipoffWatch really free?</h2>
    <p>
      Following teams, the calendar and the reminders are free and stay free. The only thing anyone
      pays for is a live stream, when someone is sharing one.
    </p>

    <h2>Open data</h2>
    <p>
      The schedule is public data, so the <a href="/api/v1">API</a> is open and needs no key. Take
      what you need.
