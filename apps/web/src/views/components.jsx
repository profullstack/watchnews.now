 *      Association" that is one word, rendered as one letter. It was reported as
 *      the NBA being mislabelled -- the data was right and the chip could not be
 *      told apart, which from outside is the same defect. So the region is shown
 *      whenever we have one.
 *   2. Identify a league at all when the abbreviation is shared. Thirteen MMA
 *      promotions abbreviate to "BFC" and two summer leagues to "NBAGS". There
 *      the short form is not brevity, it is a coin flip, so the full name wins
 *      however long it is -- unless a region settles it, which is cheaper to
