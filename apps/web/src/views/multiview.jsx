/**
 * Several of the reader's own channels on one screen.
 *
 * The page is a grid of tiles and very little else. Each tile is one channel
 * row from the reader's own list, addressed by id, and plays through the same
 * proxy route the Play button on an event page uses -- so nothing here has a
 * credential in it, and a tile is exactly as private as that button.
 *
 * The number that matters is in `data-max`: how many streams this line may hold
 * open at once. It is the line's own figure (the provider's panel, lowered by
 * the reader in settings if they like), and app.js will not start a tile past
 * it. The server enforces the same number, and past it the OLDEST stream is
 * evicted -- which on this page would look like tile one going black when tile
 * three starts. Refusing here is kinder than explaining that afterwards.
 *
 * Everything interactive is added by app.js. Without it the page still lists
 * the tiles and says what the line permits; it simply cannot play, which is the
 * same as the event page without it.
