/**
 * Which adapter's clock the freshness gate reads.
 *
 * `syncBrandCatalog` skips an adapter whose last completed pass is newer than
 * its interval. That reading used to come from `lastSyncedAtForCategory` --
 * `max(rosters_synced_at) from leagues where sport = $1` -- which says nothing
 * about WHO wrote the row, while `ingest` stamps the clock on every collection
 * the adapter touched.
 *
 * That was correct for as long as every adapter owned its sections outright. The
 * moment two file under one desk it fails silently and completely: the one that
 * runs first stamps the desk, the second reads a clock it did not set, decides
 * it is fresh, and skips -- on that tick and on every tick after, logging
 * nothing worse than "fresh (2m old)". No error, no empty table, just a provider
 * that quietly stopped.
 *
 * nichedb and brisk both write world, politics, business and the rest, so the
 * gate asks by provider now.
